The raw data for this project can be extracted from the data archive(Data_Train_Valid_Test.zip) in the repo. A folder(Data) needs to be created outside of the project to be run by the Python notebook code. Alternatively, images that have already been preprocessed can be loaded through the Python Notebooks by unzipping the numpy arrays.zip file and placing the npz files under the project/Data folder.
