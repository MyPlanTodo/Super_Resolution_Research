Abhishek's Note to TAs
I have put a copy of my notebooks outside FSRCNN_Experiments_Newer_Version for visibility but I always executed them from within this directory.
We realized just 3 hours before submission a major issue with our sampling which we fixed. however , we didn't have enough time to run all the experiments all over again.
A lot of my outputs can be see in the FSRCNN_Experiments_Newer_Version .However some of the experiments were run with old code and may not run again because the underlying code evolved time.
Some of the outputs got overriden with 1 epoch outputs duing a dummy run.
FSRCNN Notebook.ipynb notebook contains experiments with various hyperparamets like learning rate and batch size. It also contains some experiments with the layout of the network itself.It mostly contains
experiments with the transaition state 1 of FSRCNN. Also contains experiment with last layer and the activation function.
FSRCNN_DataAugmented Notebook.ipynb notebook contains experiments with data augmention and FSRCNN. 
FSRCNN_VGG Notebook.ipynb contains experiments involving VGG cost as the cost function of the network
All the files having conv in their file name are my attempts at implementing a deconvolution layer in different ways.
FSRCNN Notebook-Copy1.ipynb contains some experiments with skip connections for FSRCNN.
FSRCNN_Theano2.py contains the complete implementation for the FSRCNN full version inclduing skip connections
FSRCNN_Theano.py contains the complete implementation for the FSRCNN transition state 1 version.
FSRCNN_Theano3.py contains the complete implementation for the FSRCNN using a different kind of deconvolution layer
